Shubham's Data Structures & Algorithms Practice
Welcome to my DSA repository! This project serves as a personal log of my journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms. The solutions here are my own work, developed as part of my daily practice to strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts.

My primary language for solving these problems is Java, aligning with my career goal of becoming a proficient Java Full Stack Developer.

🎯 Purpose
The main goals of this repository are:

Consistent Practice: To solve coding problems regularly from various platforms.

Learning & Review: To create a personal knowledge base that I can revisit to reinforce concepts.

Showcase Skills: To demonstrate my problem-solving abilities and my proficiency in Java.

Code Quality: To practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized by the coding platform where the problem originated. Each problem is contained within its own named folder, which includes:

A README.md file with the problem description, constraints, and examples.

The Solution.java file containing my code.
